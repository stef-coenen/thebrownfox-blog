<p>Hi there, my name is Stef Coenen (@stefcoenen) and this is my blog. I'm a Front end Developer at Sidewalk Nv by day and a Freelance Developer by night. And thus a big coffee fan. Further more I like doing my evening run to relax after a hard day coding.</p>

<p>And so enough about myself and on about the blog. The main goal of this blog is to share opinions, architectures, snippets and much more. As long as they relate to the Front End of a Website and/or Webapp. Keep in mind that the full content of this blog is authored by Stef Coenen (@stefcoenen) unless otherwise specified. And the content should be handled as such.</p>
